/*

The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

[4, 2, 5]
x = 4

[x, 2, 5]

5 is the next greater element

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

nums1 = [4, 1, 2], nums2 = [1, 3, 4, 2]

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above
