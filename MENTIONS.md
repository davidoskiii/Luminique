# Mentions

This repository is based on the book "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom and
it's supposed to be a superset of the Lox VM written in C with a different syntax. I also
want to mention that the repository it's a personal project
and exits only for learning purposes, because of this I want to mention all of
the resources that helped me in my journey:

- **CLox, by HallofFamer** (https://github.com/HallofFamer/CLox): This repository was my second source to learn how programming languages work, in fact a lot of my VM is inspired by the CLox VM, especially the concurrency
features (generator, promise API, async/await). I really recommend to check out his repository and leave him a star.
- **clox, by mrjameshamilton** (https://github.com/mrjameshamilton/clox): Thanks to mrjameshamilton's repository I was able to expand the VM to support more than the original 255 constants per chunk.
